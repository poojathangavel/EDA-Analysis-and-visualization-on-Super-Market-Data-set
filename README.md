# EDA-Analysis-and-visualization-on-Super-Market-Data-set
Hi, I'm Pooja TN, and I'm excited to share my Internship project from CodersCave, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), analysis, and visualization of a supermarket dataset.
## Data Set Overview
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's public repository, consists of 14 attributes with 26,984 records. It encompasses a mix of integer, numeric, and string values, offering insights into transactions from 10 stores over a span of 3 months. The attributes include information on price, quantity, value, bill amount, and more.
### Project Highlights
For this project, I employed various Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and matplotlib and plotly.express for visualization. Additionally, I utilized built-in EDA functions to delve into the nuances of the dataset.

By leveraging these tools and the rich dataset, my goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights that could offer valuable information about the transactions and operations within the 10 supermarkets over the specified 3-month period.

I invite you to explore the visualizations and analyses presented in the project, and I'm open to any feedback or questions you may have.
